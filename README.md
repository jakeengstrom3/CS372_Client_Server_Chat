This is the source code for a simple client-server chat application. 

To run:
	0. Make sure python3 is installed
	
	1. Run server.py with python3 (python3 server.py)
		- This starts a server on host: localhost port: 7777
	2. Run client.py with python3 (python3 client.py)
		- This will create a client and connect to the server at localhost:7777
	3. You can now send messages from the client to the server and vice versa. 
	
Note:  - You must wait to receive a response message before you can send a new message. 
	- Messages must be less that 4500 characters in length.
